

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

## Step 1: Load the Data

```{r load-data}
# Load the dataset
data <- read_csv("All the Intermediate Colleges in Pakistan.csv")

# Display the first few rows
head(data)
```

## Step 2: Basic Data Overview

```{r data-overview}
# Get a summary of the dataset
summary(data)

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(data)

# Check for missing values
sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

## Step 3: Handling Missing Data

```{r handle-missing-data}
# Handling missing data - for simplicity, remove rows with NA values
data_clean <- data %>%
  drop_na()

# Alternatively, you can fill missing values or use more complex imputation techniques.
```

## Step 4: Univariate Analysis

### Distribution of Sector

```{r univariate-sector}
# Analyze the distribution of the 'Sector' variable
table(data_clean$Sector)

# Plot for Sector
ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = Sector)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Colleges by Sector", x = "Sector", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Distribution of Rating

```{r univariate-rating}
# Analyze the 'Rating' variable
table(data_clean$Rating)

# Plot the distribution of Ratings
ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = Rating)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of College Ratings", x = "Rating", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Step 5: Bivariate Analysis

### Relationship Between Sector and Rating

```{r bivariate-sector-rating}
# Relationship between Sector and Rating
ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = Sector, fill = Rating)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Sector vs. Rating", x = "Sector", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Relationship Between Sector and Study Program

```{r bivariate-sector-studyprogram}
# Relationship between Study Program and Sector
ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = Sector, fill = "Study Program")) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Study Program vs. Sector", x = "Sector", y = "Proportion") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Step 6: Multivariate Analysis

### Relationship Between Location, Sector, and Rating

```{r multivariate-location-sector-rating}
# Relationship between Location, Sector, and Rating
ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = Location, y = Sector, color = Rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Location vs. Sector vs. Rating") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  theme_minimal()
```
